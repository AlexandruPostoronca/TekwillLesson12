<h2>Employees</h2>
<p>Develop a class hierarchy of employees. The hierarchy should include three classes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Employee</strong> is the base class. It includes three fields (<code>name</code>, <code>email</code> and
        integer variable <code>experience</code>), one constructor with three arguments and three getters: <code>getName()</code>,
        <code>getEmail()</code>, <code>getExperience()</code>.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Developer</strong> is a subclass. It includes fields from the base class and two additional fields
        (<code>mainLanguage</code>, <code>skills</code>), one constructor with five arguments and two getters: <code>getMainLanguage()</code>,
        <code>getSkills()</code>.
    </li>
    <li><strong>DataAnalyst</strong> is another subclass. It includes fields from the base class and two additional
        fields (<code>phd</code>, <code>methods</code>), one constructor with five arguments and two getters: <code>isPhd()</code>,
        <code>getMethods()</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You need <strong>to define types of the fields and write suitable constructors. </strong>To understand it see the
    code below.</p>

<pre><code>String[] skills = { "git", "Scala", "JBoss", "UML" };
Developer developer = new Developer("Mary", "mary@mail.com", 3, "Java", skills);

String[] methods = { "neural networks", "decision tree", "bayesian algorithms" };
DataAnalyst analyst = new DataAnalyst("John", "john@gmail.com", 2, true, methods);</code></pre>

<p>It should work correctly with your class hierarchy. Do not forget to write getters with the specified name (otherwise
    the test system won't be able to check your solution).</p>
