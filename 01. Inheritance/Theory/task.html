<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p><strong>Inheritance</strong> is a mechanism for deriving a new class from another class (base class). The new class
    acquires some fields and methods of the base class. Inheritance is one of the main principles of object-oriented
    programming. It allows developers to build convenient class hierarchies and reuse existing code.</p>

<h4>Extending classes</h4>
<p>When it comes to inheritance, there are several terms. A class <strong>derived</strong> from another class is called
    a <strong>subclass</strong> (it's also known as a <strong>derived class</strong>, <strong>extended class</strong> or
    <strong>child class</strong>). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a <strong>superclass</strong>
    (also a <strong>base class</strong> or a <strong>parent class)</strong>.</p>
<p>To derive a new class from another, the keyword <code>extends</code> is used. The common syntax is shown below.</p>
<pre><code>class SuperClass { }

class SubClassA extends SuperClass { }

class SubClassB extends SuperClass { }

class SubClassC extends SubClassA { }</code></pre>
<p>There are important points about inheritance in Java:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Java doesn't support multiple-class inheritance, meaning that a class can only inherit from a single
        superclass;
    </li>
    <li>a class hierarchy can have multiple levels (class <code>C</code> can extend class <code>B</code> that extends
        class <code>A</code>);
    </li>
    <li>a superclass can have more than one subclass.</li>
</ul>
<p>A subclass inherits all public and protected fields and methods from the superclass. A subclass can also add new
    fields and methods. The inherited and added members will be used in the same way.</p>
<p>A subclass doesn't inherit private fields and methods from the superclass. However, if the superclass has public or
    protected methods for accessing its private fields, these members can be used inside subclasses.</p>
<p>Constructors aren't inherited, but the superclass's constructor can be invoked from the subclass using the special
    keyword <code>super</code>. This keyword is discussed in more detail in another topic.</p>
<p>If you'd like the base class members to be accessible from all subclasses but not from the outside code (excluding
    the same package), use the access modifier <code>protected</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Inheritance</strong> represents the <strong>IS-A</strong> relationship. A base class represents the general
    and a subclass represents the particular or specific.</p>

<h4>An example of a class hierarchy</h4>
<p>Let's consider a more graphic example. A telecommunication company serves clients. It has a small staff consisting
    only of managers and programmers. Let's consider a class hierarchy for people associated with the company's
    activities (including clients).</p>
<p>At first, we present the hierarchy as a figure. An arrow indicates that one class extends another one.</p>
<img alt="" src="12.01.1.png" width="398" style="margin: auto;">
<p><strong>The class hierarchy for the telecommunication company</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>the base class <code>Person</code> has fields for storing common data: name, year of birth, and address;</li>
    <li>the class <code>Client</code> has additional fields to store the contract number and status (gold or not);</li>
    <li>the class <code>Employee</code> stores the start date of work for the company and the salary;</li>
    <li>the class <code>Programmer</code> has an array of the programming languages a programmer uses;</li>
    <li>the class <code>Manager</code> may have a dazzling smile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see the code:</p>
<pre><code>class Person {
    protected String name;
    protected int yearOfBirth;
    protected String address;

    // public getters and setters for all fields here
}

class Client extends Person {
    protected String contractNumber;
    protected boolean gold;

    // public getters and setters for all fields here
}

class Employee extends Person {
    protected Date startDate;
    protected Long salary;

    // public getters and setters for all fields here
}

class Programmer extends Employee {
    protected String[] programmingLanguages;

    public String[] getProgrammingLanguages() {
        return programmingLanguages;
    }

    public void setProgrammingLanguages(String[] programmingLanguages) {
        this.programmingLanguages = programmingLanguages;
    }
}

class Manager extends Employee {
    protected boolean smile;

    public boolean isSmile() {
        return smile;
    }

    public void setSmile(boolean smile) {
        this.smile = smile;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This hierarchy has two levels and five classes overall. All fields are <code>protected</code> , which means they're
    visible to subclasses. Each class also has public getters and setters, but some are skipped in the code as these
    classes use the default no-argument constructor.</p>
<p>Let's create an object of the <code>Programmer</code> class and fill the inherited fields using the inherited
    setters. To read the values of the fields, we can use inherited getters.</p>
<pre><code>Programmer p = new Programmer();

p.setName("John Elephant");
p.setYearOfBirth(1985);
p.setAddress("Some street, 15");
p.setStartDate(new Date());
p.setSalary(500_000L);
p.setProgrammingLanguages(new String[] { "Java", "Scala", "Kotlin" });

System.out.println(p.getName()); // John Elephant
System.out.println(p.getSalary()); // 500000
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(p.getProgrammingLanguages())); // [Java, Scala, Kotlin]</code></pre>
<p>We also can create an instance of any class included in the considered hierarchy.</p>
<p>So,<strong> inheritance</strong> provides a powerful mechanism for code reuse and writing convenient hierarchies.
    Many things in the real world can be simulated, like hierarchies from a more general to a more particular concept.

<h4>Final classes</h4>
<p>If a class is declared with the keyword <code>final</code>, it can't have subclasses at all.</p>
<pre><code>final class SuperClass { }</code></pre>
<p>If you try to extend the class, a compile-time error will occur.</p>
<p>Some standard classes are declared as final: <code>Integer</code>, <code>Long</code>, <code>String</code>,
    <code>Math</code>. They can't be extended from.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p><strong>Inheritance</strong> allows you to build class hierarchies when subclasses (children) take some fields and
    methods of the superclass (parent). Such a hierarchy can have multiple levels, but every class can inherit only from
    a single superclass. A good class hierarchy helps to avoid code duplication and makes your program more modular. If
    a class shouldn't have subclasses, it should be marked as <code>final</code>.</p>
